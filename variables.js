//A variable is a container used to store data in memory
//In JavaScript, you can declare a variable using the var, let, or const keywords
//var is the old way of creating variables, while let and const are the modern way
//let allows creating variables whose values can change
//const is for storing data that does not change in the lifetime of an application on RAM

let score = 9000
const interestRate = 15

var userName = "Allan"

score = 800
//nterestRate = 10 // This will cause an error because interestRate is a constant
